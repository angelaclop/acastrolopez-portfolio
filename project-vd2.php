                <h3 class="h3-VD">The Brief</h3>
                <p class="plainText">
                Jewelry itâ€™s been one of my hobbies for some time now, I feel attracted to the aesthetics of accessorizing, the materials, and the production process. 
                Back in the day, making jewelry involved highly manual processes that made it exclusive and expensive. With fast-paced technology advances, it is possible now to produce affordable pieces with endless possibilities of personalization. That is the concept of 3D Jewels, to use advanced manufacturing processes to create beautiful designs that clients can buy from the comfort of their homes. The brand identity for 3D Jewels needed to reflect innovation and technology as well as elegance and sophistication.</p>
                <h3 class="h3-VD">The Process</h3>
                <p class="plainText">The initial approach was to select the representative elements of the brand, jewelry, and 3d printing process, and start creating shapes to represent them. From the first sketches, circular shapes representing the front view of a ring with a stone setting started to show something interesting. That idea iterated, incorporating the print head of the 3D printer then transforming the ring into part of the machine surrounding the diamond. Cutting the upper corner of the stone helps to represent better how 3D printing builds objects by successively adding thin layers of material. The following iterations cleaned the shape by working around positive and negative space until creating the symbol of the logo.</p>

                <h3 class="h3-VD">The Outcome</h3>
                <p class="plainText">After the symbol of the logo was ready, the next phase was to work with the brand name to reinforce the concept around 3D Jewels. A mix between serif and sans serif fonts worked well to represent the cleanness of technology and the elegance of jewelry. Ultimately, the color scheme featuring white, teal, and dark gray creates unity between the logo elements and its different variations. Once the visual components of the logo were defined, the brand starts to take form through these elements applied to the package, business cards, and the website.</p>
