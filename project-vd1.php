                <h3 class="h3-VD">The Brief</h3>
                <p class="plainText">Located in Calgary, SAITâ€™s School of Hospitality and Tourism has always been a reference of first-class education as well as high-quality food in each of its six venues throughout the city. Every location is different, each of them provide distinct atmospheres to customers and students. For that reason, the school sought after a consistent branding for all of them without losing their uniqueness.</p>

                <h3 class="h3-VD">The Outcome</h3>
                <p class="plainText">The artwork created for each bag has a line drawing that presents the essence of the venue, along with the venue logos in line, common to all designs. Therefore, there is one bag design for every location without limiting interchange when the stock is low in any of them.</p>
