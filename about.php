                <div><h2>Hola!</h2>
                <p>I'm a passionate designer, a fan of the small details that make difference. Curiosity and a strong interest for learning new things are the leads of my work.
                </p></div></div>
                <p>Every project is a new challenge and I am always eager to unroll the map and draw a new route every time. The nature of projects within the field of digital media fascinates me, by how diverse they are. Not only by their deliverables but also, by the professionals working behind them. In the end, you always learn something new, which I consider inspiring.</p>
                <p>If you like my work and consider letting me play in your team, please contact me, I will be more than happy to get involved in your new quest. Or, if you just wish to share some life experiences, we can have some coffee and talk about design, biking or cats which I'm very passionate about.</p>
