                <div><h2>Hola!</h2>
                <p>Iâ€™m Angela Castro, a graphic designer from Colombia currently living in Calgary, Canada. Passionate about digital media, and always eager to learn something new.
                </p></div></div>
                <p>As a designer, I am always curious about the thought process behind everything, a piece of furniture, an app, or a magazine. Design is always the sum of several elements that work well together, not just matching colors also, thought processes, user consideration, aesthetics and effective problem-solving. The core of my work is to pursue that ideal balance of elements in everything that I do, from branding strategy to an app. After all, design is the ground base upon which all these things take form. The cool thing is that design paths are never the same, they are always challenging and exciting.</p>
                <p>Of course, all this hard work is always better with a good cup of coffee and a great song.</p>
