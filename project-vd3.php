                <p class="intro-VD">The Odyssey coffeehouse rejoices in a cozy atmosphere and a unique coffee concept. I embarked on the adventure of creating a new branding concept for this coffee shop.</p></div>

                <h3 class="h3-VD">The Brief</h3>
                <p class="plainText">While studying, I worked as a Barista for The Odyssey. During this time, I got to love coffee even more, if thatâ€™s possible for someone born in Colombia. I was fascinated by the skills and empathy that intervene in the preparation of a good cup of coffee. Empathy is what customers value when they get their perfect skim-decaf-latte in the morning and it was empathy that drove my interest in working with the brand of this coffee house.</p>
                <p class="plainText">The Odyssey is located on SAIT's main campus in Calgary, is in the heart of students, faculty, and anyone that has visited, it offers ethically sourced coffee of the best quality and their expertise for coffee is renowned. On their first decade anniversary, the brand called for a refresh, although they had an agency to work on that, I wanted to land my inspiration and insight into an alternative design proposal.</p>
                <h3 class="h3-VD">The Process</h3>
                <figure class="singleImage">

                </figure>
                <p class="plainText">There were some places to start the ideation process. First, the name Odyssey itself brings to memory some images of adventures, old ships, and mythical gods. On the other hand, I wanted to represent the essence of the place: a throbbing passion for coffee.</p>
                <p class="plainText">Before jumping into sketching, I started by writing some descriptive words, then grouping and connecting them to get some ideas that lead the sketches into more solid concepts.</p>

                </figure>
                <h3 class="h3-VD">The Outcome</h3>
                <p class="plainText">After the symbol of the logo was ready, the next phase was to work with the brand name to reinforce the concept around 3d Jewels. A mix between serif and sans serif fonts worked well to represent the cleanness of technology and the elegance of jewelry. Ultimately, the color scheme featuring white, teal, and dark gray creates unity between the logo elements and its different variations. Once the visual components of the logo were defined, the brand starts to take form through these elements applied to the package, business cards, and the website.</p>

                </figure>
                <p class="plainText">The color selection featuring blue and brown in different shades helped to create contrast and highlight small details. This palette provided enough variations to be applied in collateral pieces, like the poster below.</p>
